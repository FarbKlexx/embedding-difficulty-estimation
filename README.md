# Abstract
Difficulty Estimation for exam items can be quite challanging, especially for teachers. But for exams to be consistent in difficulty it is important to objectively estimate the difficulty of tasks. This repository explores the estimation of item difficulty while using the multilingual-e5-large model to embed the questions and regression models to estimate the difficulty.
